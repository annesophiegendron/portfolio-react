          Hi! I'm a junior front-end developer. With over 10 years of working experience, I have had the chance to work with inspiring people who helped me to get there, first in finance, then in marketing and event management - which makes me used to handling stressful situations and knowing how valuable it is to work well with your team. <br></br><br></br> Iâ€™m creative and solution-oriented, always curious to understand how things work and how they can be improved. People describe me as a relaxed and reliable person.
          My preferred technologies right now are React and JavaScript, and I want to dig deeper into that. I also have a goal to get more into Design and UX, where I can use my creative skills to the fullest.
